# NYC Bike Rides 2019
Module 15 - Tableau
## The Data - Overview
With the help of Tableau, Pandas, and Data Visualization skills,; We hope to determine the number of bikes rides in New York during by Day, Hour, Minutes, Gender, and User Type (Customer or Subscriber). The data analysis we will conduct will include the following: Changing Trip Duration variable to datetime in Pandas, checkout times for users, checkout times by gender, trips by weekday per hour, trips by gender (weekday per hour), and user trips by gender by weekday. In addition, some visuals may also have filter options available to dive deeper in to the NYC bikers data.

This line graph examines the trip duration of all riders (all user types and genders) by the hour and by the minute. To simplify the data, the data has been filtered to only contain the duration from 0 to 2 hours since most trips are less. The data suggest that most riders have a trip duration of 0 to 30 minutes.

Next, we examine the number of bike rides by gender, broken down by the hour and by the minute once again. The data can be filtered by gender and hour of day. The Male riders tend to rent bikes more often, however, their trip duration follows the same trends for all genders, where the average trip duration is from 0 to 30 minutes. Female Riders tend to rent bikes less often, but when they do ride, their trip duration has a similar trend to the males â€“ 0 to 30 minutes.

The data is visualized to show the Number of Bike Rides by Day and Time. The darker the area, the denser the data is, meaning the more bike rides during that time of day. The greatest amount of bike rides happens Thursday afternoon from 5 to 7pm. In turn, the least amount of bike rides is every morning from 12-5am.

Similarly, to the previous visualization, this examines the number of bike rides by day and time, with the addition of gender trends. Like we pointed out previously, the male population tends to ride more bikes, which is why the chart. The most popular time for Male bikers is weekdays from 7-10am and Weekdays (excluding Wednesdays) from 5-7pm. The most popular time for Female bikers is Thursdays around 5 or 6 pm.

This heat graph analyzes the number of bike rides by User Type, by Day, and by Gender. Most rides coming from the Male Gender, specifically the Subscribers. Female Subscribers ride more bikes than the Customer Females. This is yet another great way to visualize what type of riders use the bikes in NYC.
